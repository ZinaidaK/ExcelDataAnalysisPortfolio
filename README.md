# Bikes Sales Analysis


## Project Description:
In this data analysis project, I focused on exploring and understanding bike purchase trends among a diverse group of customers. The dataset, titled "bike_buyers," consists of several key attributes including marital status, gender, income, number of children, education level, occupation, home ownership, car ownership, commute distance, region, age, and whether or not the individual purchased a bike.

## Methodologies Used:

**Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Initially, I reviewed the dataset for completeness and consistency, addressing any missing or inconsistent data entries to ensure accuracy in analysis.

**Descriptive Analysis:** I conducted a comprehensive analysis to summarize the demographics and characteristics of the bike buyers and non-buyers. This included assessing income levels, educational backgrounds, and regional distribution.

**Segmentation Analysis:** Using criteria such as age, income, and region, I segmented the customer base to identify patterns and trends in bike purchasing behavior.

**Visualization:** Key findings were visualized in the "Dashboard" sheet, providing a clear and concise representation of bike buying trends among different demographic groups.


## Outcomes:

**Demographic Insights:** The analysis revealed distinct buying patterns based on marital status, gender, and age. For example, professionals in the age range of 35-45 showed a higher propensity to purchase bikes.

**Income and Education Correlation:** A correlation between income levels, education, and bike purchasing behavior was identified, indicating that higher income and education levels positively impact the likelihood of purchasing a bike.

**Regional Trends:** The data highlighted regional differences in bike purchases, with certain areas showing a higher density of buyers.


## Conclusion:

This project not only allowed for a deep dive into the factors influencing bike purchases but also provided actionable insights for targeting potential buyers more effectively. The use of Excel for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization facilitated a thorough examination of customer data, leading to a better understanding of market dynamics.
